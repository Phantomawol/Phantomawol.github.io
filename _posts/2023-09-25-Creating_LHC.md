I want to apologize for taking so long to post this...hopefully, won't be too long before my next post.

# Lonely Hackers Club

I wanted to start with something cheesy like "Once upon a time..." or "The greatest lonely hacker group ever created", but I thought: Let's be honest, that would be fun, but people would find that too cheesy and click off the blog.

I want to start by saying thank you to everyone who made LHC what it is today and everyone who continues to help. I couldn't have done it without you! **(Also huge shoutout to Defcon for making us an official room at Defcon 31! We will be back better than ever!)**

### The Creation of Lonely Hackers Club

It all started pre-Defcon 25. This was going to be my first-ever hacking convention and I was a total noob. (I still feel like one...) I wrote on Defcon Reddit asking: What are some things I should and shouldn't do for my first Defcon? Of course, I got the classic "Do not attend talks as they will be recorded" which is 100% true.
A user (whose real name I never got to know) went by Kat, reached out to me, and also stated it was their first Defcon. We had an idea to start a telegram chat for people who were first-time attendees or just wanted to meet up with like-minded people. Lonely Hackers Club was spawned. 

At first, it started super slow, people would come and go after Defcon would attend. Kat ended up stepping away from LHC shortly after it was created, so I was left alone to figure out what we would become. Shortly after, I started meeting some super cool people who I then decided to make admins. (Sorry in advance if I forget any of the OG admins)
The first admins who helped with some still helping today were: Win, H4r0ld, V3rbaal, Altezza, SapiTim, TechGirlMN, Sunstrid3r, Alofoxx, Hamy, & Bog

### LHC today

As of writing this blog, we have about 930 members with 50-60 active at any given time! We are always willing to help anyone and also good to know that we officially have (had) a room at Defcon 31! (Huge thanks to SethOps!) We are hoping to get a room every year going forward, but this will be our "beta" run if you want to call it that. Mostly this year we were a chill room mixed with Resume reviews, a name that noob, and more! Hopefully, you stopped by to see us and if not we will be back next year! We also have a meet-up every year, so the best details for that would be to join the telegram group.

**Please let us know in the Telegram chat what you would like to see next year! We are open to suggestions and hopefully, Defcon will accommodate.**

I want to shout out the current admins who helped me and the past admins who have stepped down.
